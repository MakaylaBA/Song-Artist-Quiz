The concepts from module 2 used in this project are 
1) Component class relationship
2) File input

This program creates two different quizzes for the user to take. One has the user guess the artist who sings the given 
song, and the other has the user guess which artist is a part of the given Music label. I used the Quiz and Question 
classes from the custom quiz guided project to help make my quizzes. There are also a Song class which has an artist,  
an Artist class, and MusicLabel class which has a vector of the artists on the label. The main program asks what the 
user would like to do, and gives the option to play either game or exit

At the moment there are no known bugs.

In the future I want to consider adding multiple MusicLabels, or changing the game so that if you play again the
questions and answers change. I would also like to do something with the graphics module, like make more options in the
table where you can see an artists information and it shows a picture or maybe add some graphics during or after the 
quizzes. Also with more time I might add a lyrics component to the song and some sort of quiz to go along with that.

I used the Quiz and Question classes from custom quiz. 

I think I deserve around 90-100 points.

My main program is interactive and uses several module 2 concepts, and validates all input, so I think I should get around 40 points for this section.
For the testing program, I believe I made it very robust and organized. Each class has its own testing function, and each method has several testing cases. So I think I deserve 20 points. 
In my program I used the component class (has a) relationship several times (in MusicLabel, Song, and Quiz). I believe all of these were implemented and designed well, so I think I deserve around 40 points
And I only used file input once for the quiz, so I think I should get around 5 points for this section. 
And I don't think I should lose any points from the last 3 sections.
