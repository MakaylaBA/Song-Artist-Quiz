#Song and Artist Quizes
Makayla Alber

This program was coded in C++

This program creates two different quizzes for the user to take. One has the user guess the artist who sings the given 
song, and the other has the user guess which artist is a part of the given Music label. Currently, the quizzes are hard coded and the artists, songs and label can not be changed by the user with in the program
The Quiz and Question classes were created form source code provided by Lisa Dion. 
There is also a Song class which has an artist, an Artist class, and a MusicLabel class which has a vector of the artists on the label. 
The main program asks what the user would like to do, and gives the option to play either game or exit

At the moment there are no known bugs.
